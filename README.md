# Important Notes

Pagination — The limit parameter is set to 500. If your organisation has more submissions in the time window, you will need to paginate by incrementing offset. The response includes current_item_count to help determine if more pages exist.

Time window — Adjust the after and before parameters in the params dict to match your desired query range.

Permissions — The user running the script must have write access to the target log file path.

Config security — Protect tg_config.py with chmod 600 tg_config.py.

API key in URL — The v2 endpoint passes the API key as a query parameter. 
Ensure you use HTTPS (which the default base URL does) so the key is encrypted in transit.
